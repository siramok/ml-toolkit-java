# ISU CS 4478/5578 Machine Learning Toolkit<br/>
This is an example ml-toolkit project structure made with IntelliJ IDEA. It uses Gradle as the build tool and (optionally) JUnit4 for writing and running tests. If you would prefer to create your own project structure from scratch, the relevant files to copy over to your new project are located under /src/main/java/toolkit/.
